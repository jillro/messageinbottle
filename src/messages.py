Welcome ! This is _Message in a bottle_ bot.

Send a message to the bot. Someone will get it, and you will get someone else message. If you want, you can leave \
contact information in your message, so they can write you back.

You can write to specific channels using #hashtags in your message. Only users using the same #hashtags \
combination can get your message.

BOTTLES_HELP = """
You just received a message in a bottle. If you want, you can answer back and try to start a conversation.

Or you will not, because this is not the person you want to talk with. But that does not mean this person can not be \
a nice person to meet for other people! In order to create interesting spaces for everyone, we want to encourage \
people who write long and interesting messages, which can lead to inspiring connections.

Therefore, whether you answer them or not, if you think this person should be able to send more messages, you can send \
their bottle back. Or maybe this is just trash, and you will let the bottle sink in the sea, where you found it.

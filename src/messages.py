WELCOME = """
Welcome ! This is the _Message in a bottle_ bot.

Simply send a message to this bot. If someone comes after you, it will be forwarded to them. If you want, you can \
leave contact information in your message so the next person can answer you back.

You will receive a message let by another user just after sending yours.

If you use #hastags in your message, you will receive messages (if any) sent by users who put the same combination of \
hashtags. It is like a separate channel in the sea !

When you send a message, you use a bottle. If someone likes your message, they can send you \
the bottle back so you can send another one. You start with 5 bottle. When you have used all your bottles, you get \
a new one after 12 hours.

‚ö†Ô∏è This bot is still in development and test. There may be many bugs. Please don't send it to all your friends \
without author agreement.

Sorry! No message was ever sent with this hashtags combination... but yours will be sent if \
someone comes after you.

WELCOME = """
Welcome ! This is the _Message in a bottle_ bot.

Simply send a message to this bot. If someone comes after you, it will be forwarded to them. If you want, you can \
leave contact information in your message so the next person can answer you back.

You will receive a message let by another user just after sending yours.

If you use #hastags in your message, you will receive messages (if any) sent by users who put the same combination of \
hashtags. It is like a separate channel in the sea !

When you send a message, you use a bottle. If someone likes your message, they can send you \
the bottle back so you can send another one. You start with 5 bottle. When you have used all your bottles, you get \
a new one after 12 hours.

‚ö†Ô∏è This bot is still in development and test. There may be many bugs. Please don't send it to all your friends \
without author agreement.
"""

NO_MESSAGE_EVER = """
Sorry! No message was ever sent with this hashtags combination... but yours will be sent if \
someone comes after you.

YOU_AGAIN = """
Sorry ! The last person to send a message here was...you ! So we just replaced the first message by the new one.

MESSAGE_INTRO = """
Thanks for your message! It will be delivered to the next person. Here is a message from {}:

No more bottles!

BOTTLES_HELP = """
You just received a message in a bottle. If you want, you can answer back and try to start a conversation.

Or you will not, because this is not the person you want to talk with. But that does not mean this person can not be \
a nice person to meet for other people! In order to create interesting spaces for everyone, we want to encourage \
people who write long and interesting messages, which can lead to inspiring connections.

Therefore, whether you answer them or not, if you think this person should be able to send more messages, you can send \
their bottle back. Or maybe this is just trash, and you will let the bottle sink in the sea, where you found it.
